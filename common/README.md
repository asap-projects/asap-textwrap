# Common submodule for the asap project

See the asap project on [GitHub](https://github.com/abdes/asap) for a functional
minimal starter project that uses this submodule.

This submodule is not intended to be used alone. Instead, refer to the asap
project for the recommended container to fully leverage this submodule and add
other libraries/executables/etc... to the top level project.

Functionality offered by this submodule includes:
  - cmake build helpers for the end-to-end lifecycle in 'cmake' subdirectory
  - assertions
  - logging using spdlog
  - unit testing using Catch2
  - documentation using restructured text with
    [sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)
  - API documentation using [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org), translated to
    reST using [breathe](https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
