 * \brief C++ lightweight mixin support library.
 *
 * The idea with mix-ins is to provide a bunch of primitive classes, where each
 * of them models a basic orthogonal concept, and be able to stick them together
 * to compose more complex classes with just the functionality you want. The
 * primitive classes themselves are meant to be used as building blocks. This is
 * extensible since later on you can add other primitive classes to the
 * collection without affecting the existing ones.
 *
 * A technique for doing this in C++ is using templates and inheritance. The
 * basic idea here is you connect these building blocks together by providing
 * them via the template parameter. You then chain them together, eg. via
 * typedef, to form a new type containing the functionality you want.
 *
 * **What's a mixin**
 *
 * A mixin is a template struct/class that:
 *  - inherits publicly from its only template parameter (the CRTP pattern). It
 *    is allowed to also inherit from other things,
 *  - has a constructor that forwards arguments its does not consume to its
 *    base.
 *
 * \code
 * template<Base>
 * struct my_mixin : Base { // and any other additional bases
 *
 *   // A mixin must forward the constructor parameters it does not consume
 *   // add the parameters to your mixin at the front, before `rest`
 *   template <typename...Args>
 *   my_mixin(Args&&... rest) : Base(std::forward<Args>(rest)...) {}
 *
 *   // public interface methods
 *
 *   // private state
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Mixins can have state, which should be implemented with private data members.
 * Access to the state information should be provided via the public interface.
 * That way, mixins are self-contained, their interface is clear and conflicts
 * with other mixins are minimized.
 *
 * *Composing mixins*
 * Mixins are added to a class using chain inheritance, where each layer
 * inherits from the layer before it. At the end, the resulting class (which is
 * the one we'll be using) is the most derived class and provides the interfaces
 * of all mixins used to build it.
 *
 * One problem remains though: just like that, mixins are restricted on which
 * functionality they can use from other mixins. Interoperability between mixins
 * works only in the direction of the inheritance chain. For example, if we are
 * using a logging mixin with a persistence mixin, then the persistence mixin
 * can use the logging interface as long as it is mixed-in after the logging
 * mixin. But this is not really what we want as conceptually, mixins are a set
 * and we want to be able to compose them in any order we want.
 *
 * In order to deal with this elegantly, we automatically add a top layer in the
 * chain (not a mixin), that will track the 'most derived class' (the one with
 * all the mixins interfaces) and offer access to a `self` that is the result of
 * casting `this` to that **most derived class**. This layer is the initial base
 * in the inheritance chain and is therefore visible from any other mixin.
 *
 * When defining a concrete class using mixins, you don't need to do anything to
 * benefit from the above quality of life improvement. Simply declare mixins as
 * usual and access their interfaces via `this->self()`. We need to have
 * `this->` because `self()` is a *dependent* name (i.e. depends on the template
 * parameter but is not declared within the template).
 *
 * \snippet mixin_top_test.cpp Mixin calls other mixin
 *
 * The order in which you use compose the concrete class using the above mixins
 * is not important, thanks to the top layer and to the trick of providing
 * access to the `most derived class` via `self()`. In the example below, the
 * two classes, `Concrete` and `Concrete2`, are equivalent:
 *
 * \snippet mixin_top_test.cpp Composition order does not matter

 * This is not a mixin. It's simply the top layer in the mixin chain, with the
 * bottom layer being the `most derived class`. This layer is automatically
 * added to the chain in order to provide access to the `most derived class`
 * from within any mixin in the chain. This trick is extremely powerful and
 * allows any mixin to access any public interface in another mixin or in the
 * base class. Simply use `this->self()` (note that `this->` here is required
 * due to the fact that `self()` is a dependent name).

 *
 * The helpers in this implementation detail block are here to simplify the
 * right-folding of the mixins template parameters and the automatic chaining of
 * the `MixinTop` layer. This concretely results in an inheritance chain that
 * starts with the `MixinTop` and ends with the Concrete class, adding an
 * inheritance level for each template parameter (a Mixin) because every Mixin
