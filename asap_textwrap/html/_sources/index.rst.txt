Welcome! This is the documentation for the *textwrap* module, part of the *asap*
project. This modules provides helpers to format text in columns with a maximum
width. When a line of text is longer than its column's maximum width, the text
is automatically wrapped. A number of other features are also supported, such as
adding an initial indent, indenting all lines, etc... Refer to the API
documentation for more details.

Text can also be laid out by composing columns together in a multi-column
layout, suitable for tabular data, definitions, etc.
