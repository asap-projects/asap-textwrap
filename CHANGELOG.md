## 1.0.0 (2022-03-06)

This is a major refactoring of the `asap` family of projects and as such,
introduces several breaking changes from the old model of `asap` projects.

This is a C++ library to format text in columns with a maximum width. When a
line of text is longer than its column's maximum width, the text is
automatically wrapped. A number of other features are also supported, such as
adding an initial indent, indenting all lines, etc... Refer to the API
documentation for more details.
