Welcome! This is the documentation for the *asap* project. This is the top level
container project for the asap modules. It provides the integrated build system
and the overall structure for projects following the asap development workflow.

The main goal from this family of modules and projects is to significantly cut
the bootstrap time of starting a new c++ application, using CMake as the build
system.
